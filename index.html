                    <h2>Expert in Building Revenue Engines</h2>
                    <p>I'm Michael Hissey, founder of Hissey GTM Consulting. I've spent my career building go-to-market systems that drive real revenue growth in high-growth environments.</p>
                    
                    <p>Most recently, I've worked across fintech, executive networks, and multi-family office services—translating complex products into clear market narratives, building demand generation campaigns, and aligning marketing, sales, and ops teams around shared pipeline goals.</p>
                    
                    <p>I have worked inside companies rather than advising from the outside. I have managed campaigns, built workflows in Clay, written copy, planned events, and optimized conversion paths. I know what the work actually looks like because I have done it.</p>
                    
                    <p>Most consultants deliver a strategy document and disappear. I help you build the roadmap and then stay to execute it with you. Strategy matters, but someone has to do the actual work.</p>
